# Unity ML-Agents Toolkit with Hugging Face ü§ó

This is a Fork of the Unity ML-Agents toolkit. This version allows you to **publish your trained agents in one line of code to the Hugging Face Hub**, **download powerful agents** from the community, and **watch a replay of your agent without using the Unity Editor**.

‚ö†Ô∏è This is an experimental version, that might be subject to change. If you **encounter some issues, please open an issue**.

## Get started

‚û°Ô∏è We wrote a complete tutorial to learn to **train your first agent using ML-Agents and publish it to the Hub**: 

### Step 1: Install the package
```
pip install git+https://github.com/huggingface/ml-agents.git
```

### Step 2: Download the executable based on your system or use Unity Editor directly



## Additional Resources

We have a Unity Learn course,
[ML-Agents: Hummingbirds](https://learn.unity.com/course/ml-agents-hummingbirds),
that provides a gentle introduction to Unity and the ML-Agents Toolkit.

We've also partnered with
[CodeMonkeyUnity](https://www.youtube.com/c/CodeMonkeyUnity) to create a
[series of tutorial videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzDRvYVwl53vehwiN_odYJkPBzcqFw110)
on how to implement and use the ML-Agents Toolkit.

We have also published a series of blog posts that are relevant for ML-Agents:
